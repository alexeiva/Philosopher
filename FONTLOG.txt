FONTLOG for the Philosopher font

This file provides detailed information on the Philosopher 
font Software.

This information should be distributed along with the 
Philosopher fonts and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

Philosopher was started in 2008 and takes inspiration from Agfa Rotis and ITC Binary. This font is universal: It can be used in logos, headlines, and for text. The initial version of the font was deliberately spread with errors - this was my invaluable contribution to type culture around the world, as I thought then - I wanted to stir up designers so they began working with fonts, rather than passively using what is there. Over time I wanted to correct the errors, and now the font has been used by millions of people worldwide.

In June 2011 a four-style family was published, and in September 2011 the full Latin and Cyrillic family was fully hinted.

Philosopher is a Unicode typeface family that supports 
languages that use the Latin, and Cyrillic scripts and its variants, and could be expanded to support other scripts.

More specifically, this release supports the following Unicode
ranges: Latin-1, GF Cyrillic Plus
